Last week, I attended <a href="http://eurosys2017.org/">The European Conference on Computer System (EuroSys)</a>, which was held at the Crown Plaza hotel in Belgrade, Serbia.

Being a conference-newbie so to say, I must say that EuroSys was highly impressive. Specifically, the conference room provided was big enough to hold the ~300 people that attended.
